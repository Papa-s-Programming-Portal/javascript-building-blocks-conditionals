When you're ready to test your skills, this repository contains copies of the starting points for the four tasks of

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills:_Conditionals

You can work in the _Test your skills_ web page and copy your code into these files when you're done or want help, or you can work directly in these files. To test your files from here in GitHub, you can download each file and open it as a local file in your browser. Alternatively, you can enable Pages for your repository (sorry, this isn't set up by default).  Then, a minute or two after each commit, you should be able to view your work in GitHub Pages.

## Notes

### Task 1

This task says

> To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether `season` contains the string "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to `response`.

I interpret this to mean that the final version of what you write should first test if `season` is summer and assign an appropriate message to `response` if it is. Next, it should test if `season` is winter and assign an apprpropriate message if it is. Finally, if `season` is neither, it should assign a message saying that we don't know what season it is.

### Commit Messages

Remember that you'll need to commit each file with a commit message like "done" or "submission" or "ready for review" when, well, you're done and ready for your work to be reviewed. If you want help with something, commmit with a message that begins with something like "question about" or "help requested."  If you're committing your work before it's done just to save it, your commmit message can say what you've done/what's left to do, maybe starting with "saving my work" or "intermediate files" or whatever.
