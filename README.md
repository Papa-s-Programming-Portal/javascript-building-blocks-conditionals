When you're ready to test your skills, this repository contains copies of the starting points (conditionals1.html and the other three) for the four tasks of

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills:_Conditionals

You can work in the _Test your skills_ web page and copy your code into these files when you're done or want help, or you can work directly in these files. If you work directly in these files, to test your work, you can download each file (and the styles.css file, once) and open each HTML file as a local file in your browser. Alternatively, you can enable Pages for your repository (sorry, this does not happen automatically).  Then, a minute or two after each commit, you should be able to view your work in GitHub Pages.

## Notes

### Task 1

This task says

> To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether `season` contains the string "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to `response`.

I interpret this to mean that the final version of what you write should first test if `season` is summer and assign an appropriate message to `response` if it is. Next, it should test if `season` is winter and assign an apprpropriate message if it is. Finally, if `season` is neither, it should assign a message saying that we don't know what season it is.

### Task 2

This task says

> Inside the first, you need to nest...

I think what they mean is, inside the first part of the if-else that you have written.  So the idea is, you are first testing if the machine is on.  If not, you are setting the response to say so.  If it is on, then in the first part of this if-else you need to nest...

If you want to, you could try adding a text box where the score can be entered and a button that can be clicked to submit the score (see the First Steps Assessment code to see how this is done if you have forgotten). This would make it much easier to test with different scores.

### Commit Messages

Remember that you'll need to commit each file with a commit message like "done" or "submission" or "ready for review" when, well, you're done and ready for your work to be reviewed. If you want help with something, commmit with a message that begins with something like "question about" or "help requested."  If you're committing your work before it's done just to save it, your commmit message can say what you've done/what's left to do, maybe starting with "saving my work" or "intermediate files" or whatever.
