You can work in the web page and copy your code into these files when you're done or want help, or you can work directly in these files. To test your files from here in GitHub, you can either download each file and open it as a local file in your browser, or, after it deploys, view it in Pages.  If you're using Pages, here are links to each file (these only work when viewing the deployed page):

- [conditionals2.html](conditionals2.html)
- [conditionals3.html](conditionals3.html)
